Hi there! This is not really a source code file, this is an easter egg! 
Congratulations!

Actually this is a file which I list all the easter eggs in ZEsarUX, 
so you can easily try them. 

Please, keep the list secret and don't tell anyone,
let's keep the magic :)

So, the list:

1. This file. This is a simple easter egg, but it is one, right? XD

2. Using ZRCP, run the command "easter-egg". See what happens...

3. Using ZRCP, run the command "ATDT". There's a funny answer to that

4. Enable ZX Desktop. Go to the about menu, and you'll see something different... 
The answer for that change, in the FAQ

5. Disable ZX Desktop. Go to the about menu, press F key (used to find text). 
Just press enter with no text to find. You'll see a cursor in the window,
select the second line and press Enter...
